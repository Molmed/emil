`emil`: Evaluation of Modeling without Information Leakage
==========================================================
[![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/emil)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/emil/index.html)

The `emil` package for R is a toolbox for designing and evaluating predictive models with resampling methods.
The aim is to provide a simple and efficient general framework
for working with any type of prediction problem, be it classification,
regression or survival analysis, that is easy to extend and adapt to your
specific setting.
Some commonly used methods for classification, regression and survival analysis
are included.
