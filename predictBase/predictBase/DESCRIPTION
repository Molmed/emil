Description: A toolbox for designing and evaluating predictive models with
  resampling methods. The aim of this package is to provide a simple and
  efficient general framework for working with any type of prediction problem,
  be it classification, regression or survival analysis, that is easy to extend
  and adapt to your specific setting. Therefore it only includes one model type
  (linear discriminant) to serve as an example. For a collection of ready-to-use
  models types please refer to the full `predict` package.
